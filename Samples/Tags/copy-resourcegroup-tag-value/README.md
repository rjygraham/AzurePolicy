# Copies a Resource Group tag value to another tag

This policy will copy a Resource Group tag value to another tag on the same Resource Group. This is useful in situations where you need to bulk rename tags. Rather than write a script to rename then tag, simply apply this policy and then and then apply another policy to remove the old tag name.
